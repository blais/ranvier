   CHANGES: ranvier
======================

Current
=======

* Fixed bug with urlopen() specifying the mode.

* Arrange to automatically append a trailing slash to non-leaf resources that
  get served, in order to minimize redirection if _training_slash is true.

* Implement forward matching without going via the resource tree, and return a
  dict of the matched values.  Do this with a regexp, you give it a URL and it
  attempts to match it and return the components.  Should be easy
  The tests can use this in order to check for specified resulting URLs with
  values.

* Added option for sorting pretty render resources

* Made the pretty render resources accept default values as args
