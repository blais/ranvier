   ranvier: A Powerful URL Mapper
====================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents


Description
===========

Ranvier is a Python library that can be integrated in any web application
framework to map an incoming URL to a resource (controller).

It can also serve as a central registry of all the URLs that are served from a
web application and can generate the URLs necessary for cross-linking pages.  If
you use this library to map and generate all your URLs you should be able to
completely rearrange the layout of your site without breaking the pages nor the
tests.

- Python 2.4
