Current
=======

(code)

* Coverage report should render aliases gray as well.

* ranvier-static-check: 

  - Fix a bug: multiple resources on the same source line will not be found!

* It would be nice to be able to create aliases to paths with components that
  include file extensions, e.g. /photos/(number).jpg; we cannot do this at the
  moment within ranvier (but we can hack it with a rewrite rule).

  Maybe just implement this by supporting an extension for the final component,
  something a bit exceptional.

* We need to provide a way to ignore rendered resources as well, not just
  handled, e.g. @@AdwordsTracking, is never rendered and it's ok.

* We need to provide a way to ignore all the resources located under the 'test'
  folder.

  1. Provide a delegater resource that disables coverage tracking, so that all
     mapping performed under that resource will not show up later in the
     coverage report.    Maybe that's too complicated?

  2. Or perhaps provide a way to obtain all the resources under a specific node
     of the tree, in order to provide that list to the coverage reporter to
     ignore.

* We have an issue: a folder with default, that has a target resource-id, will
  never get marked as handled by the coverage analysis because it always
  forwards to its default, which ends up being the resource that is being
  served.  I'm not sure how to untangle this (not that this matters much
  anywayâ€¦).


(promotion)
* Send Ranvier information to twill list when the coverage analysis is done.


Redirection Oddity
==================

* Investigate this: when you just return a Location: header without a status,
  Apache goes into an infinite loop.  What is this implementation of internal
  redirect?  Look for internal redirection on Wikipedia.
