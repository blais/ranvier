Current (For Release)
=====================

(code)

* Provide logging of request path in the resource tree via the reporters, e.g.

    @@Root -> @@FolderWithMenu -> @@<Resource>

* We need to provide a way to ignore rendered resources as well, not just
  handled, e.g. @@AdwordsTracking, is never rendered and it's ok.

* We need to provide a way to ignore all the resources located under the 'test'
  folder.

  1. Provide a delegater resource that disables coverage tracking, so that all
     mapping performed under that resource will not show up later in the
     coverage report.    Maybe that's too complicated?

  2. Or perhaps provide a way to obtain all the resources under a specific node
     of the tree, in order to provide that list to the coverage reporter to
     ignore.


* We have an issue: a folder with default, that has a target resource-id, will
  never get marked as handled by the coverage analysis because it always
  forwards to its default, which ends up being the resource that is being
  served.  I'm not sure how to untangle this (not that this matters much
  anyway…).


(promotion)
* Send Ranvier information to twill list when the coverage analysis is done.


Future Tasks and Ideas
======================

Callback Resource
-----------------

- Maybe we could provide a simple callback caller resource, and implement
  ResetCoverage using that?


Node Visitor
------------

- Provide a way to visit the resource nodes of the entire tree.  We could use
  this to let the resources specify little bits of CSS code and have the visitor
  reconstruct the style file from those.  This provides a new opportunity for
  localizing all this stuff in the resource handler, although we may prefer to
  let the resources be entirely separate.  I don't know.  But at least we should
  provide a generic visitor interface.


Emacs Helper Mode
-----------------

- Provide some kind of hook in emacs to fetch the list of resources from my
  running web app, and then interactively insert by proposing amongst one of the
  valid forms.  At least I want to be able to view the complete list in an emacs
  buffer without having to cut-n-paste and open a file manually.


Multiple Components in a Row
----------------------------

* branch_var should accept a tuple of variable names, and the same should go for
  declare_serve(), so that we can express consuming more than a single path
  component:

     /doc/<year>/<month>/<date>
     /doc/<year>/<month>/<date>/view


Custom Validation on Back-Mapping URLs
--------------------------------------

* It would provide even more robustness and verification if it was possible for
  the resources that consume components to provide some kind of validation for
  those components, so that when we back-map URLs for rendering more
  verification is performed that just “we have the parameter”.


Map Multiple URLs
-----------------

* Add a simple interface to be able to map “n” URLs (``mapurln(..)``) with the
  same arguments.


Features in Docs
----------------

* Implement all the remaining features described in the docs


Interfaces
----------

* Check out if WSGI dictates some kind of standard interface for implementing a
  response proxy.


Random Tests
------------

* We could use the introspection provided by url_variables() to generate
  fetchers with random data for urls that require arguments.


Query Parameters
----------------

* We also need to support query parameters for static mappings.

* Think about integrating the parameters with the query arguments at some point,
  so that we can generate URLs like this (maybe this could be done automatically
  by passing in extra arguments instead of raising an error):

     /a/bli/blou?myextra=42

* The enumerator visitor could be augmented with a method to accept declaration
  of possible query arguments, some being mandatory (this sounds like a cool
  idea).

  Also, a special function could be provided to do these declarations given an
  Atocha form, thus providing us with the complete interface to a speciific
  resource.  The pretty renderer could take advantage of that by rendering a
  nice table with those, and the fields' titles could even be declared as well,
  so that we can render a good interface of a resource.

* Add the following methods::

    declare_param( ..., optional=True ) -> adds a query arg

      ##     def declare_queryargs( self, varname, default=None, optional=False ):
      ##         """
      ##         Declare query arguments for this resource as a leaf.  Query arguments
      ##         can be optional, and can have default values only if they're not
      ##         optional.
      ##         """
      ##         assert not (optional and default)
      ## ## FIXME todo


    Only parameters can be optional.  Variables are required.

    Find a way to map the position parameters to the URL, in order.

Extra and Privileges
--------------------

- Add a optional parameter 'extra' which can be used to indicate, for
  informational purposes only, what extra data is involved/considered during
  the traversal for a particular leaf resource.  This can be used to display
  the privileges that are involved in accessing a single resource.


Template Replacement
--------------------

* We could provide a simple template replacement library in this package that
  replaces a simple syntax embedded in HTML::

      <a href="@@Profile(username=username, ...)">Search</a>

  This should be configured to use an appropriate mapper beforehand.  This
  should be trivial to implement.  Templates are a really stupid idea though--at
  least for a programmer--so this should be given low priority.


Redirection Oddity
------------------

* Investigate this: when you just return a Location: header without a status,
  Apache goes into an infinite loop.  What is this implementation of internal
  redirect?  Look for internal redirection on Wikipedia.


Formats for static routes
-------------------------

* Implement format support for static routes, we will need to detect the format
  from the given URL pattern, extending that syntax somehow.


Better Static Checking
----------------------

* Extend static checker script to look for parameters and to warn when it is
  likely that parameters have been forgotten or are missing or extraneous
